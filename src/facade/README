Facade Pattern
=================

I can hardly call this a pattern, because it's just encapsulating complicated things
and provide simple interface (function calls) for client code. It's like you write a
class of 100 methods but only 1 of them are `public` because that's the only method
your client need to call, and all of a sudden such natural practice becomes "facade pattern".

And now you can always say CLI programs are using facade patterns because internally
they have many modules but to use it their users only need to know those CLI options.
